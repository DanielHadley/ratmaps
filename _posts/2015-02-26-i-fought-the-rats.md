title: How My City is Fighting Rats and Winning
tags: Somerville rats stats data

Three years ago, the city where I work was dealing with an onslaught of rats. Like its neighbor Boston, Somerville had just emerged from one of its mildest winters in history. [Winter Storm Juno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2015_North_American_blizzard) alone dumped more than three times as much snow on the region than was recorded during the entire winter of 2011-2012. And as a result, the rodent population seemed to grow out of hand that spring. 

At the time, I directed the Mayor's Office of Innovation and Analytics. Calls to Somerville's 311 line complaining about rodents were up 65%. Residents looked to Mayor Curtatone for help.

I recall riding in the back seat of a vehicle while the Mayor rode shotgun. He would say things like, "My friend John told me they have a problem on Pearl Street." And, "my barber saw an infested dumpster over there." 

With each stop, we would compare our findings with maps from the 311 calls, making note of the hot spots.

## RatStat

Having data from the 311 line made a huge difference. The calls don't tell you everything; but when we combined that data with information from our health inspectors, a clearer picture emerged. 

We began a series of meetings we called "RatStat." There were public health professionals, data analysts, ISD and DPW workers, and strong support from the Mayor. Other elected officials got involved too. Data was central to these meetings. 

As Denise Taylor the communications director put it, "every city has a rat problem. We have a rat plan."

## Some Solutions that Worked

At each RatStat meeting, participants would look at maps and charts to determine where the problem properties were located.

It was clear we had to cut off food supplies. The inspectional services director ramped up trash tickets, and made a case for adding new personnel to inspect and certify dumpsters more often. This alone seems to have had a significant impact. Private dumpsters that once remained unchecked for weeks or even months were now being issued tickets for overflowing trash. 

In addition, we purchased specialized 64-gallon barrels for every property in the City. Before, trash day meant seeing a hodgepodge of cans and barrels, many too small for the amount of trash they were holding. We crunched the data on our trash and discovered that while the average load is more like 33 gallons, there were enough outliers that we needed larger barrels to accommodate everyone. 

We even considered testing a rat sterilization program. But between the trash inspections, cleaning, and a major outreach effort, it was difficult to find infested sites by the time a team of sterilization experts had arrived. 

## The Results

The best way to test whether our program worked or not was to compare our data to that of Boston. I used a specialized tool developed by data scientists at Google called "CausalImpact." The results were amazing. After implementing our new programs, calls dropped by an estimated 30%.

Like every city in the region, Somerville will always have a rat problem. But these results show that a city can fight back by using data-informed policies.
