According to dailymail.co.uk: 
<blockquote>Mice recognise fear in their friends' faces: Rodents may use expressions to warn others of danger or ask for help

Researchers in Tokyo placed rats in a cage with three compartments

One room showed photos of rats in pain, and another with neutral faces

Rats spent more time in the 'neutral' room suggesting they recognise fear

Experts believe facial expressions are used to communicate with others

Charles Darwin argued that animals can express emotions with their face and body, like humans do.

Now researchers have found that rats can recognise pain the faces of their fellow rodents.

The study suggests that as well as expressing their emotional state, the pained faces of rats may have a ‘communicative function’.

They may even use expressions to warn other rats of danger or ask for help.

Researchers have found that rats can recognise pain the faces of their fellow rodents .Researchers based at different institutions in Tokyo, noted that rats flatten their ears, narrow their eyes and puff up their cheeks when they are in pain (shown in the images on the right) – an observation in previous studies
