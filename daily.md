Each red dot represents one call about a rat seen in that location. The dots are transparent, so multiple calls from one location will be seen as a solid dot. The usual caveats apply: more calls do not necessarily mean that there are more rats in that location than other parts of the city. A cluster of dots could indicate that one resident is unusually vocal about rodents in his or her neighborhood. Also, more densely populated neighborhoods tend to make more calls to 311.
