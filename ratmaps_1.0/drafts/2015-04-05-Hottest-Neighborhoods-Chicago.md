title: The Top 5 Hottest New Neighborhoods For Rats in Chicago
tags: Chicago Rats Neighborhoods 311 Rat Sightings
---

Chicago is known for having one of the largest rat populations in the country. It also has a well known 311 line, which thousands of residents avail themselves of every year to complain about said rats. To find out which neighborhoods have seen the largest increase in rats, I looked at the patterns in those calls. The neighborhoods I list below are the places where rat calls went up the most during the last twelve months relative to similar periods in previous years. In other words, if there were rat real estate agents, what would they list as the hottest new neighborhoods?

How to read the maps: each transparent dot represents one call to the City's 311 line complaining about rats in the last 12 months. Solid dots represent three or more calls from that location. I've isolated the neighborhoods so you won't see calls from nearby community areas. If you want to see maps of all calls from the last few years, check out the [Chicago section](http://ratmaps.com/chicago/neighborhoods/) of this site.
