Boston is where this whole crazy project started for me. I was working in the Mayor's Office of Innovation and Analytics in the City of Somerville when I was asked to compare our 311 data to Boston's. Somerville was experiencing an above-average volume of calls about rodents, and we wanted to see if the problem was unique to our city, or if it was a problem for the entire region. At the time, we learned that the trends in our rodent calls nearly mirror Boston's. 

In the course of doing this comparison, I also made some quick maps and threw them up online. There was enough interest that I told myself one day I would make a map for each city that publishes its data.
