I must begin with a caveat: the City of San Francisco does not distinguish between rodent calls and insect calls. These dots are all calls to the City's 311 line about infested buildings; but the city unfortunately logs them all as "Infestation_Rodent_Insect." 

That said, I think the maps give a plausible sense of where rodents might be located in SF. Many residents were horrified by "Rat Girl," a woman who bred and [unleashed](http://blog.sfgate.com/stew/2014/05/30/s-f-at-loss-over-rat-girls-rodent-hoarding-video/) rats into the city. I could not tell from the news reports where she was living when they found her with "[300 rats in deplorable condition](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/weird/San-Francisco-Woman-Breeds-Rats-Releases-Them-in-City-Parks-261331461.html)" But if someone does know that, it may be interesting to cross check these maps with the location of the hotel.
