I am the Chief of Staff to Mayor Joe Curtatone of Somerville, Massachusetts. (*DISCLAIMER: I don't speak for the Mayor or the City on this blog. These are my opinions.*) Previously I was the director of the Mayor's Office of Innovation and Analytics. Prior to that I studied planning, real estate, and statistics at Harvard, where I earned a Master of Urban Planning.
