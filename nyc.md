Where are New York City's rats seen most often? How many of them are there? One urban legend states that there is at least one rat for every New Yorker - approximately 8.5 million. But that myth was [debunked](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/nyregion/8-million-rats-in-new-york-data-suggest-that-legend-is-flawed.html?_r=0) by a young statistician named Jonathan Auerbach, who used 311 call data to estimate the number of rats living in New York City. According to his [award-winning research](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2014.00764.x/asset/sign764.pdf;jsessionid=0B57CD44148F76769EFF4C0F738CB31B.f03t01?v=1&t=i653uwza&s=e8bf02da98f38e671bfea957e71df2b60aeca37e), the rat population is actually more like two million.

2,000,000 rats! For a City with a land area of only 305 square miles, that's significant - especially given the fact that many rats cluster in certain neighborhoods.        

## Citywide 

Auerbach estimated that 40,500 lots were infested by rats. That's about 4.75% of all lots in the City. It's impossible to tell from the maps exactly which lots are infested; but it is possible to get a sense of which neighborhoods report more rat sightings.

## Brooklyn

Remember, each transparent dot represents one call made to the 311 line over nine years. Obviously, more populous neighborhoods will generate more calls. That said, Brooklyn is still remarkable for the volume off calls it produces.

## Staten Island

To make an unfair comparison (unfair because it has such a lower population density), here is Staten Island.
