## A. Rats in the city <a id="rats-in-the-city"></a>

#### How do rats get into my home? <a id="home"></a>

They enter through any hole or crack available to them. They can fit into holes that are barely the size of a quarter, such as gaps in the drywall or small holes for pipes or wires. They often chew through vents, or find loose siding. If gaps around a door are larger than 3/8 inch, rats can squeeze through those too.  

In the scariest cases, rats can even climb up through toilet plumbing, as [this nightmare-inducing gif illustrates](http://img0.joyreactor.com/pics/post/gif-rat-toilet-662598.gif).

It is common for overgrowth and debris to block entry sites from a homeowner's view. That is why it is important to clear debris and inspect for possible entry sites on a semi regular basis.   


#### What do rats eat in the city? <a id="eat-what"></a>

Mainly human trash, although they also eat pet food and pet waste, fruit from trees, and even other rats in hard times. They have been known to [develop a taste for familiar foods](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/new-york-city-rats-wont-eat-just-anything.html).


#### How can I report a rat to my city or town? <a id="report"></a>

Many cities have a 311 line for reporting non-emergencies, such as rat sightings. Often, there are also websites or apps that allow you to report rats. For example, [this](http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2374/rodent-complaint) is the website for reporting rats in New York City. 

If your local government does not have a 311 line, I recommend googling the contact information for the director of public health. If you do not get a response from him or her, it may be worth writing back and CCing some of your local elected officials.

## B. About This Site <a id="about-rat-maps"></a>

#### Where does the data come from? <a id="here-data"></a>

All data come from 311 calls to the cities that are featured here. In most cases, the city has a work-order type that they use to document when a citizen calls to complain about a rat.


#### Do more calls mean more rats, or just more people to call about them? <a id="more-calls-mean"></a>

Both. Population density is correlated to the number of rodent calls both because there are more rats living off human garbage, and because there are more people to see them. I have noticed locations where a *lot* of people live yet there are relatively few rat calls. Often these are parts of the city where people live in high-rise towers.

## C. About Me <a id="about-me"></a>

#### Why did you create this site? <a id="why"></a>

I work for a city where rats are a perennial problem. I first wanted to see if this was the case in other cities. I hope that if people see the data, it might help them address the problem in their neighborhood.
