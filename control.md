## A. What are signs that I have rats in my home or yard? <a id="rats-in-the-home"></a>

### Burrows, tracks, gnaw marks and droppings <a id="signs"></a>

Most rats live in nests or burrows. Burrows are holes in dirt or concrete from one to four inches wide, with smooth edges. Burrows can be found under bushes and plants. They will often have an entrance and exit hole.

Other signs your property may be infested include

+ rat droppings
+ chewed holes in walls, doors, or floors
+ holes and gnaw marks on trash barrels
+ holes in bags of pet food, trash, or bird seed
+ signs of runways on walls or grass.  

Rats run along the same path many times a day, leaving dark greasy track marks along walls and worn down paths in grass. 


### Clusters of sightings <a id="clusters"></a>

If your city is one that is [featured on Rat Maps](ratmaps.com/cities), you may be able to visually inspect the maps to look for clusters of sightings in your neighborhood. A group of several sightings may indicate that rodents are prevalent in a certain neighborhood. It may also mean that people are very proactive about calling the city to report rats, so be sure to check for other signs before assuming that your house has a problem.

## B. How do I get rid of rats? <a id="get-rid-of-rats"></a>

Many experts recommend cleaning and rat-proofing your house before trapping and baiting. I agree that is important, but I also think that once you realize you have an infestation, your first priority is to get rid of it. That's why I begin my guide with advice on trapping, and end with [recommendations](#keep-rats-away) on how to keep rats out of your home.  

### Trap them <a id="trap-rats"></a>

Rat traps have gone through an interesting evolution - from [this hilarious contraption](http://i.imgur.com/oSFEBLY.jpg) to what is arguably the cleanest, easiest, and least disgusting solution on the market today: the Rat Zapper.

To use this trap, you simply put pet food or peanut butter in the chamber, turn it on, wait until the LED light glows red, and then tip it into a garbage can to let the dead rodent slip out. You don't run the risk of getting rat guts all over, as you might from a snap trap. Instead, rodents are shocked with a quick but powerful jolt of electricity.

### Snap, glue, and humane traps

The main alternatives to an electric trap are snap traps:

Glue traps:

And humane traps:

For those who would prefer to avoid killing rats or waking up to something [like this](http://imgur.com/sItkaVY), the humane solution is to place bait in the back of an animal trap, and then check it frequently to release any caged rats back into the wild.
