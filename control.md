## A. What are signs that I have rats in my home or yard? <a id="rats-in-the-home"></a>

### Burrows, tracks, gnaw marks and droppings <a id="signs"></a>

Most rats live in nests or burrows. Burrows are holes in dirt or concrete from one to four inches wide, with smooth edges. Burrows can be found under bushes and plants. They will often have an entrance and exit hole.

![signs that rats are in your home]({{ site.cityimages }}/control/Signs_that_rats_are_in_your_home.png)

Other signs your property may be infested include

+ rat droppings
+ chewed holes in walls, doors, or floors
+ holes and gnaw marks on trash barrels
+ holes in bags of pet food, trash, or bird seed
+ signs of runways on walls or grass.  

Rats run along the same path many times a day, leaving dark greasy track marks along walls and worn down paths in grass. 


### Clusters of sightings <a id="clusters"></a>

If your city is one that is [featured on Rat Maps](http://ratmaps.com/cities), you may be able to visually inspect the maps to look for clusters of sightings in your neighborhood. A group of several sightings may indicate that rodents are prevalent in a certain neighborhood. It may also mean that people are very proactive about calling the city to report rats, so be sure to check for other signs before assuming that your house has a problem.

## B. How do I get rid of rats? <a id="get-rid-of-rats"></a>

Many experts recommend cleaning and rat-proofing your house before trapping and baiting. I agree that is important, but I also think that once you realize you have an infestation, your first priority is to get rid of it. That's why I begin my guide with advice on trapping, and end with [recommendations](#keep-rats-away) on how to keep rats out of your home.  

### Trap them <a id="trap-rats"></a>

Rat traps have gone through an interesting evolution - from [this hilarious contraption](http://i.imgur.com/oSFEBLY.jpg) to what is arguably the cleanest, easiest, and least disgusting solution on the market today: the Rat Zapper.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002665ZTC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002665ZTC&linkCode=as2&tag=rama0f9-20&linkId=A7YKGIUMNJSBVJH3"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B002665ZTC&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=rama0f9-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=rama0f9-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002665ZTC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

To use this trap, you simply put pet food or peanut butter in the chamber, turn it on, wait until the LED light glows red, and then tip it into a garbage can to let the dead rodent slip out. You don't run the risk of getting rat guts all over, as you might from a snap trap. Instead, rodents are shocked with a quick but powerful jolt of electricity.

The trick to setting an effective trap is to search for signs like the ones mentioned in first part of this guide. Set traps alongside walls near droppings, holes or tracks. 

### Snap, glue, and humane traps

The main alternatives to an electric trap are snap traps:

</center>

Glue traps:

</center>

And humane traps:

For those who would prefer to avoid killing rats or waking up to something [like this](http://imgur.com/sItkaVY), the humane solution is to place bait in the back of an animal trap, and then check it frequently to release any caged rats back into the wild.

### Poison them <a id="poison-rats"></a>

Many [experts](http://www.attic-rat.com/howtopoison.html) recommend against poisoning rats. Rodenticides (poison) can be dangerous to children, pets, and [other wildlife](http://www.audubon.org/magazine/january-february-2013/poisons-used-kill-rodents-have-safer). In addition, it is not as effective as many people assume, and can lead to rat carcasses in your attic, basements or crawl spaces. 

That said, one of the more popular solutions is the Tomcat Bait Chunx:

</center>

I recommend reading carefully about how to place rodenticides out of the reach of pets and children, and possibly consulting an expert, such as a professional pest control worker.

## C. How can I keep rats from coming back? <a id="keep-rats-away"></a>

We are going to get into some DIY projects, so get your tools ready. 

### Wash away droppings and track marks <a id="wash"></a>

Rats communicate and attract each other through their urine and droppings. Sweep droppings and then wash down the area with water and a mild bleach solution (one part bleach, 10 parts water).

<center>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FDX7YD0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FDX7YD0&linkCode=as2&tag=rama0f9-20&linkId=GLTVDBHPRHLYITI4"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDX7YD0&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=rama0f9-20" ></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=rama0f9-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00FDX7YD0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

</center>

### Get rid of clutter <a id="clutter"></a>

Clutter gives rats lots of places to hide, sleep, nest and reproduce. 

+ Remove (and recycle) piles of newspapers, paper bags, cardboard and bottles.
+ Clear out your basement and yard.
+ Store items away from walls and off the ground.


### Control Weeds, Shrubs and Bushes <a id="overgrowth"></a>

Rats are often found in burrows under bushes and plants.

+ Keep tall grass, bushes, shrubs and mulch away from building foundations. 
+ Pull out ivy around burrows.
+ Keep ground bare six inches from buildings, and trim under shrubs.
+ Make space between plants and avoid dense planting.
+ Keep gardens free of weeds and trash.

</center>

### Starve them <a id="starve-them"></a>

Rats only need one ounce of food each day. Don’t make your garbage their food. 

Manage Your Garbage:
+ Bring trash barrels to the curb as close to pick-up time as possible. Leaving bags outside overnight invites rats.
+ Recycle as much as possible to reduce trash.
+ Make sure you have enough trash barrels with tight lids to hold trash during the week between pickups.
+ Use hard plastic or metal trash barrels with tight fitting lids. Look for gnaw holes.
+ Insist that tenants put garbage inside trash barrels.

</center>

Keep Food Away:
+ Keep all food in tightly sealed containers.
+ Don’t put food out for stray cats, pigeons, or squirrels.
+ Put bird food in feeders only, and don’t overfeed. Store seeds in containers with tight lids.
+ Compost properly.


### Seal cracks, gaps, and holes <a id="seal-spaces"></a>

Rats chew holes into buildings, and can squeeze through cracks and holes as small as a half inch. To keep rats out for good, seal all holes and cracks in foundations, walls, floors, underneath doors and around windows. Materials are inexpensive and can be purchased by following links from the images below.

+ Seal cracks and small holes with caulk. Or use roofing cement – it’s durable and easily applied with a caulking gun.

+ Use mortar or ready-mix cement to fill gaps and holes in cement and stone foundations. Cover large holes with metal lathe or screening, then seal with mortar or cement.
+ Cover floor drains and vents with heavy-duty metal screening, secured with masonry nails or cement.

+ Install sheet metal kick plates on the lower exterior of doors where rats have been gnawing or entering the building. Install metal thresholds underneath.
+ Use door sweeps to keep gaps under doors smaller than a quarter inch.
+ Consider installing sheet metal between foundations and the ground.

### Finally, close all visible burrow holes <a id="close-burrows"></a>

+ Close burrows in soil by filling with soil and tamping down with a shovel, or by stepping on them.
+ Close burrows in cracked or broken sidewalks with metal filler and cement.
