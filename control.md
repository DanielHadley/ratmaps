## A. What are signs that I have rats in my home or yard? <a id="rats-in-the-home"></a>

### Burrows, tracks, gnaw marks and droppings <a id="signs"></a>

Most rats live in nests or burrows. Burrows are holes in dirt or concrete from one to four inches wide, with smooth edges. Burrows can be found under bushes and plants. They will often have an entrance and exit hole.

![signs that rats are in your home](http://googledrive.com/host/0BxOPuM_gK7bqUW85bjZUd1UwTGs/faqs/Signs_that_rats_are_in_your_home.png)

Other signs your property may be infested include

+ rat droppings
+ chewed holes in walls, doors, or floors
+ holes and gnaw marks on trash barrels
+ holes in bags of pet food, trash, or bird seed
+ signs of runways on walls or grass.  

Rats run along the same path many times a day, leaving dark greasy track marks along walls and worn down paths in grass.   


### Clusters of sightings <a id="clusters"></a>

If your city is one that is [featured on Rat Maps](ratmaps.com/cities), you may be able to visually inspect the maps to look for clusters of sightings in your neighborhood. A group of several sightings may indicate that rodents are prevalent in a certain neighborhood. It may also mean that people are very proactive about calling the city to report rats, so be sure to check for other signs before assuming that your house has a problem.   

Mainly human trash, although they also eat pet food and pet waste, fruit from trees, and even other rats in hard times. They have been known to [develop a taste for familiar foods](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/new-york-city-rats-wont-eat-just-anything.html).


#### How can I report a rat to my city or town? <a id="report"></a>

Many cities have a 311 line for reporting non-emergencies, such as rat sightings. Often, there are also websites or apps that allow you to report rats. For example, [this](http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2374/rodent-complaint) is the website for reporting rats in New York City. 

If your local government does not have a 311 line, I recommend googling the contact information for the director of public health. If you do not get a response from him or her, it may be worth writing back and CCing some of your local elected officials.

## B. About This Site <a id="about-rat-maps"></a>

#### Where does the data come from? <a id="where-data"></a>

All data come from 311 calls to the cities that are featured here. In most cases, the city has a work-order type that they use to document when a citizen calls to complain about a rat.


#### Do more calls mean more rats, or just more people to call about them? <a id="more-calls-mean"></a>

Both. Population density is correlated to the number of rodent calls both because there are more rats living off human garbage, and because there are more people to see them. I have noticed locations where a *lot* of people live yet there are relatively few rat calls. Often these are parts of the city where people live in high-rise towers.

## C. About Me <a id="about-me"></a>

#### Why did you create this site? <a id="why"></a>

I work for a city where rats are a perennial problem. When I first started developing this project, I wanted to see if this was the case in other cities. 

I hope that if people see the data, it might help them address the problem in their neighborhood. At the very least, I hope people enjoy looking at the maps and spotting trends.
